# FYP_TaskManager
This is a Task Manager application done with React Native and Firebase. The objective of this project is to provide a mobile application that allows convenient monitoring and organization of userâ€™s tasks. It would minimize the risk of missing out on deadlines, while also providing an overview of their work-life balance.

With an intuitive user flow, the application grants customization within the app, as well as the ability to assign and prioritize tasks with ease. Some of the main features such as image/file attachments, calendar integration, sharing and exporting of tasks allows our target users to go about completing their tasks with increased productivity.
